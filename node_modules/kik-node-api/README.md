### Getting Started

You can use the API by creating an instance of `KikClient`, you'll use it to listen
to events and send requests to kik

```javascript
const KikClient = require("kik-node-api");

Kik = new KikClient({
    username: "username",
    password: "1234",
    promptCaptchas: true,
    trackUserInfo: true,
    trackFriendInfo: true
});

Kik.connect()
```
`username`: your kik account's username 

`password`: your kik account's password

`promptCaptchas`: prompt in the console to solve captchas. If not you must handle it yourself using the [event](#received-captcha)

`trackUserInfo`: track users and return their usernames and display names in the events when possible

`trackFriendInfo`: track friends and return their usernames and display names in the events when possible

All users are represented in a js object that looks like this:
```
user: { 
    jid: "kikteam@talk.kik.com", 
    username: "kikteam",
    displayName: "Kik Team",
    pic: "http://profilepics.cf.kik.com/luN9IXX3a4sks-RzyiC7xlK-HdE"
}
```
groups are represented in the following js object:
```
group: { 
    jid: "1100221067977_g@groups.kik.com", 
    code: "#kikbotapi",
    name: "Kik Bot API Unofficial",
    users: ["jid1", "jid2", "jid3"]
}
```
private groups have a code of null

### Events
#### The Basics

`KikClient` uses Node's [Event Emitter](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html) class
to handle events, all events are attached in the following way:

```javascript
Kik.on(eventname, (param1, param2) => {
    //do stuff with params here
})
```

Below are the details of all events emitted by the `KikClient` class

```javascript
Kik.on("authenticated", () => {
    console.log("Authenticated")
})
```

```javascript
Kik.on("receivedroster", (groups, friends) => {
    console.log(groups);
    console.log(friends)
})
```

Kik.on("receivedcaptcha", (captchaUrl) => {
    console.log("Please solve captcha" + captchaUrl)
